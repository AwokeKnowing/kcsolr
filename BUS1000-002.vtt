1
00:00:00.096 --> 00:00:05.047
you're the four functions if you would of 
management first of all you have the planning

2
00:00:06.002 --> 00:00:10.079
the planning stages basically you were choosing appropriate 
 organizational goals and courses

3
00:00:11.018 --> 00:00:13.003
action to best achieve those goals

4
00:00:14.006 --> 00:00:15.084
and that simply means that you can be 
 coming together

5
00:00:16.084 --> 00:00:21.061
talking about the overall plan could be short 
term planning could be long term planning but

6
00:00:21.061 --> 00:00:24.086
you gonna sit down and find out 
where the company needs to do and what direction

7
00:00:24.095 --> 00:00:28.055
it needs ahead and that is the 
essence of the planning stage you have to sit

8
00:00:28.055 --> 00:00:30.012
down and map it all out

9
00:00:30.092 --> 00:00:33.087
then the organizational skills come into play the 
 organizing

10
00:00:35.061 --> 00:00:41.029
establish task and authority relationships that allow people 
 to work together to achieve

11
00:00:41.069 --> 00:00:42.049
organization

12
00:00:43.001 --> 00:00:43.084
and goals

13
00:00:44.031 --> 00:00:45.094
this is the part that a little bit 

14
00:00:47.001 --> 00:00:50.059
give and take because you're going to want 
to organize you can have a very a

15
00:00:50.059 --> 00:00:52.012
different personalities in the room

16
00:00:52.082 --> 00:00:56.075
but what's going to happen eventually you're gonna 
 come hopefully to the same accord

17
00:00:57.017 --> 00:01:00.003
the same concept because you're initially going to 
be looking at the mission statement of the

18
00:01:00.003 --> 00:01:05.011
company engraved on the planning stage and 
now you can actually think about organizing organizing or

19
00:01:05.011 --> 00:01:06.084
thought which direction heading now

20
00:01:07.062 --> 00:01:10.053
they all would need the next phase which 
 is called leading

21
00:01:11.003 --> 00:01:13.044
you have to have someone is going to 
 motivate you coordinate

22
00:01:13.095 --> 00:01:19.000
and energize individuals and groups to work together 
 to achieve or additional goals

23
00:01:19.086 --> 00:01:23.054
i like that particular area because of the 
fact that it goes back to communication skills

24
00:01:24.048 --> 00:01:30.005
effective communication and open communication allows for this 
next process to take place very smoothly if

25
00:01:30.056 --> 00:01:35.091
you do have the open communication skills 
left for the leading you have to coordinate motivate

26
00:01:36.016 --> 00:01:37.077
and inspire your employees

27
00:01:38.082 --> 00:01:42.095
then you get to one area that that 
little touchy touchy feely as well the controlling

28
00:01:42.098 --> 00:01:43.053
stage

29
00:01:44.019 --> 00:01:47.007
now that sounds like a word that you 
play would want to use in business with

30
00:01:47.007 --> 00:01:51.073
controlling what it actually is the essence 
of what's going to happen in terms of establishing

31
00:01:51.076 --> 00:01:52.019
accurate

32
00:01:52.006 --> 00:01:59.055
measurement a measurement tool and monitoring systems to 
evaluate how wealthy organization has achieved its goals

33
00:01:59.096 --> 00:02:03.005
so vera's apart that a lot of companies 
 do on a regular basis

34
00:02:03.035 --> 00:02:07.071
they do the controlling at a community college 
 level we call it student learning outcomes

35
00:02:08.026 --> 00:02:10.048
which means at the end of the course 

36
00:02:10.083 --> 00:02:13.085
they do the communication of business english we 
 stop for a minute

37
00:02:14.036 --> 00:02:18.083
we assessed what we've done determine whether or 
not the students will be successful and whether

38
00:02:18.083 --> 00:02:22.021
they have achieved what we said they 
would achieve in the beginning here the same thing

39
00:02:22.021 --> 00:02:23.005
for companies

40
00:02:24.013 --> 00:02:27.049
they want to have an accurate measurement of 
 what they've done

41
00:02:28.005 --> 00:02:30.075
and i ask for functions of management

42
00:02:31.067 --> 00:02:34.072
here some steps in the planning process let's 
 think about this for a minute

43
00:02:35.058 --> 00:02:36.053
everything we do

44
00:02:37.014 --> 00:02:38.023
takes time

45
00:02:38.077 --> 00:02:42.095
and have to be accurate especially in business 
so you have to have the planning process

46
00:02:43.018 --> 00:02:44.002
the steps to it

47
00:02:44.061 --> 00:02:46.027
first of all you want to decide

48
00:02:46.092 --> 00:02:49.026
deciding which goal the organization will pursue

49
00:02:49.097 --> 00:02:55.035
now we are speaking of the mission statement 
we're speaking of individual goals that allow and

50
00:02:55.035 --> 00:02:57.055
support the mission statement of most companies

51
00:02:57.095 --> 00:03:02.039
so for example let's say how we're going 
green now so environmentally your first goal is

52
00:03:02.039 --> 00:03:06.059
to make sure that your company hopefully 
is at a satisfactory level of being green

53
00:03:07.028 --> 00:03:10.034
that when you first of all decide what 
to go you're going to be if you're

54
00:03:10.034 --> 00:03:12.016
going to go gold a greenish it's 
a

55
00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.005
deciding what course of action to adopt at 
 this point

56
00:03:16.068 --> 00:03:18.039
to attain those goals

57
00:03:18.072 --> 00:03:20.065
which means you have top down leadership

58
00:03:21.018 --> 00:03:27.000
maybe bottom up leadership or legal leadership which 
means across the board deciding what courses of

59
00:03:27.003 --> 00:03:29.033
action to adopt to attain those goals

60
00:03:29.095 --> 00:03:32.001
what happens is a lot of people they 
 start out

61
00:03:32.082 --> 00:03:36.038
in business and is then whatever they've done 
 over the years will be effective

62
00:03:36.091 --> 00:03:41.051
and they don't adopted the changes we speaking 
of technology we're speaking of cultural differences we're

63
00:03:41.051 --> 00:03:43.003
speaking of maybe even look halliday

64
00:03:43.062 --> 00:03:47.065
all those things have to be taken into 
consideration so deciding what course of action to

65
00:03:47.065 --> 00:03:48.016
adopt

66
00:03:48.055 --> 00:03:50.008
to attain those goals is part of the 
 planning

67
00:03:51.003 --> 00:03:52.079
process one of the steps

68
00:03:53.058 --> 00:03:58.064
step three is deciding how to allocate organizational 
 resources here comes the money

69
00:03:59.079 --> 00:04:00.075
here comes the people

70
00:04:01.029 --> 00:04:03.056
here comes the man power

71
00:04:04.002 --> 00:04:09.039
this is when you decide how much you 
need to put into particular goals and turns

72
00:04:09.039 --> 00:04:13.004
up the resources and manpower as well 
as let's say %HESITATION

73
00:04:13.078 --> 00:04:17.087
transferring in people from other companies though this 
when you actually sit down and you allocate

74
00:04:18.041 --> 00:04:21.011
what's going to allow you to achieve those 
 goals

75
00:04:21.087 --> 00:04:23.082
very very tangible resources as well
