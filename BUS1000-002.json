stages basically you were choosing appropriate \n organizational goals and courses\n\n3\n00:00:11.018 --> 00:00:13.003\naction to best achieve those goals\n\n4\n00:00:14.006 --> 00:00:15.084\nand that simply means that you can be \n coming together\n\n5\n00:00:16.084 --> 00:00:21.061\ntalking about the overall plan could be short \nterm planning could be long term planning but\n\n6\n00:00:21.061 --> 00:00:24.086\nyou gonna sit down and find out \nwhere the company needs to do and what direction\n\n7\n00:00:24.095 --> 00:00:28.055\nit needs ahead and that is the \nessence of the planning stage you have to sit\n\n8\n00:00:28.055 --> 00:00:30.012\ndown and map it all out\n\n9\n00:00:30.092 --> 00:00:33.087\nthen the organizational skills come into play the \n organizing\n\n10\n00:00:35.061 --> 00:00:41.029\nestablish task and authority relationships that allow people \n to work together to achieve\n\n11\n00:00:41.069 --> 00:00:42.049\norganization\n\n12\n00:00:43.001 --> 00:00:43.084\nand goals\n\n13\n00:00:44.031 --> 00:00:45.094\nthis is the part that a little bit \n\n14\n00:00:47.001 --> 00:00:50.059\ngive and take because you're going to want \nto organize you can have a very a\n\n15\n00:00:50.059 --> 00:00:52.012\ndifferent personalities in the room\n\n16\n00:00:52.082 --> 00:00:56.075\nbut what's going to happen eventually you're gonna \n come hopefully to the same accord\n\n17\n00:00:57.017 --> 00:01:00.003\nthe same concept because you're initially going to \nbe looking at the mission statement of the\n\n18\n00:01:00.003 --> 00:01:05.011\ncompany engraved on the planning stage and \nnow you can actually think about organizing organizing or\n\n19\n00:01:05.011 --> 00:01:06.084\nthought which direction heading now\n\n20\n00:01:07.062 --> 00:01:10.053\nthey all would need the next phase which \n is called leading\n\n21\n00:01:11.003 --> 00:01:13.044\nyou have to have someone is going to \n motivate you coordinate\n\n22\n00:01:13.095 --> 00:01:19.000\nand energize individuals and groups to work together \n to achieve or additional goals\n\n23\n00:01:19.086 --> 00:01:23.054\ni like that particular area because of the \nfact that it goes back to communication skills\n\n24\n00:01:24.048 --> 00:01:30.005\neffective communication and open communication allows for this \nnext process to take place very smoothly if\n\n25\n00:01:30.056 --> 00:01:35.091\nyou do have the open communication skills \nleft for the leading you have to coordinate motivate\n\n26\n00:01:36.016 --> 00:01:37.077\nand inspire your employees\n\n27\n00:01:38.082 --> 00:01:42.095\nthen you get to one area that that \nlittle touchy touchy feely as well the controlling\n\n28\n00:01:42.098 --> 00:01:43.053\nstage\n\n29\n00:01:44.019 --> 00:01:47.007\nnow that sounds like a word that you \nplay would want to use in business with\n\n30\n00:01:47.007 --> 00:01:51.073\ncontrolling what it actually is the essence \nof what's going to happen in terms of establishing\n\n31\n00:01:51.076 --> 00:01:52.019\naccurate\n\n32\n00:01:52.006 --> 00:01:59.055\nmeasurement a measurement tool and monitoring systems to \nevaluate how wealthy organization has achieved its goals\n\n33\n00:01:59.096 --> 00:02:03.005\nso vera's apart that a lot of companies \n do on a regular basis\n\n34\n00:02:03.035 --> 00:02:07.071\nthey do the controlling at a community college \n level we call it student learning outcomes\n\n35\n00:02:08.026 --> 00:02:10.048\nwhich means at the end of the course \n\n36\n00:02:10.083 --> 00:02:13.085\nthey do the communication of business english we \n stop for a minute\n\n37\n00:02:14.036 --> 00:02:18.083\nwe assessed what we've done determine whether or \nnot the students will be successful and whether\n\n38\n00:02:18.083 --> 00:02:22.021\nthey have achieved what we said they \nwould achieve in the beginning here the same thing\n\n39\n00:02:22.021 --> 00:02:23.005\nfor companies\n\n40\n00:02:24.013 --> 00:02:27.049\nthey want to have an accurate measurement of \n what they've done\n\n41\n00:02:28.005 --> 00:02:30.075\nand i ask for functions of management\n\n42\n00:02:31.067 --> 00:02:34.072\nhere some steps in the planning process let's \n think about this for a minute\n\n43\n00:02:35.058 --> 00:02:36.053\neverything we do\n\n44\n00:02:37.014 --> 00:02:38.023\ntakes time\n\n45\n00:02:38.077 --> 00:02:42.095\nand have to be accurate especially in business \nso you have to have the planning process\n\n46\n00:02:43.018 --> 00:02:44.002\nthe steps to it\n\n47\n00:02:44.061 --> 00:02:46.027\nfirst of all you want to decide\n\n48\n00:02:46.092 --> 00:02:49.026\ndeciding which goal the organization will pursue\n\n49\n00:02:49.097 --> 00:02:55.035\nnow we are speaking of the mission statement \nwe're speaking of individual goals that allow and\n\n50\n00:02:55.035 --> 00:02:57.055\nsupport the mission statement of most companies\n\n51\n00:02:57.095 --> 00:03:02.039\nso for example let's say how we're going \ngreen now so environmentally your first goal is\n\n52\n00:03:02.039 --> 00:03:06.059\nto make sure that your company hopefully \nis at a satisfactory level of being green\n\n53\n00:03:07.028 --> 00:03:10.034\nthat when you first of all decide what \nto go you're going to be if you're\n\n54\n00:03:10.034 --> 00:03:12.016\ngoing to go gold a greenish it's \na\n\n55\n00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.005\ndeciding what course of action to adopt at \n this point\n\n56\n00:03:16.068 --> 00:03:18.039\nto attain those goals\n\n57\n00:03:18.072 --> 00:03:20.065\nwhich means you have top down leadership\n\n58\n00:03:21.018 --> 00:03:27.000\nmaybe bottom up leadership or legal leadership which \nmeans across the board deciding what courses of\n\n59\n00:03:27.003 --> 00:03:29.033\naction to adopt to attain those goals\n\n60\n00:03:29.095 --> 00:03:32.001\nwhat happens is a lot of people they \n start out\n\n61\n00:03:32.082 --> 00:03:36.038\nin business and is then whatever they've done \n over the years will be effective\n\n62\n00:03:36.091 --> 00:03:41.051\nand they don't adopted the changes we speaking \nof technology we're speaking of cultural differences we're\n\n63\n00:03:41.051 --> 00:03:43.003\nspeaking of maybe even look halliday\n\n64\n00:03:43.062 --> 00:03:47.065\nall those things have to be taken into \nconsideration so deciding what course of action to\n\n65\n00:03:47.065 --> 00:03:48.016\nadopt\n\n66\n00:03:48.055 --> 00:03:50.008\nto attain those goals is part of the \n planning\n\n67\n00:03:51.003 --> 00:03:52.079\nprocess one of the steps\n\n68\n00:03:53.058 --> 00:03:58.064\nstep three is deciding how to allocate organizational \n resources here comes the money\n\n69\n00:03:59.079 --> 00:04:00.075\nhere comes the people\n\n70\n00:04:01.029 --> 00:04:03.056\nhere comes the man power\n\n71\n00:04:04.002 --> 00:04:09.039\nthis is when you decide how much you \nneed to put into particular goals and turns\n\n72\n00:04:09.039 --> 00:04:13.004\nup the resources and manpower as well \nas let's say %HESITATION\n\n73\n00:04:13.078 --> 00:04:17.087\ntransferring in people from other companies though this \nwhen you actually sit down and you allocate\n\n74\n00:04:18.041 --> 00:04:21.011\nwhat's going to allow you to achieve those \n goals\n\n75\n00:04:21.087 --> 00:04:23.082\nvery very tangible resources as well\n\n",
